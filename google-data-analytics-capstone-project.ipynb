    "\r\n",
    "##### It's not a surprise that the member riders number of rides are the highest during the weekdays from Mon through Fri, while it drops on weekends - the reason for that is that member riders mostly use the bikes for commuting. In terms of the months, it's also not a surprise that member riders mostly ride bikes during spring, summer and fall, while their rides decrease during the winter due to the weather conditions. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Avg duration: \r\n",
    "##### The data analysis shows a different story when we compare the membership type by the average duration of the ride. We see that the casual riders' average duration of the ride is more than 3 times higher than the members' for all weekdays. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "##### The same is true for month-to-month comparison. We see that the casual riders' average duration of the ride is more than 3 times higher for most of the months, while winter shows the highest difference and spring the lowest difference. It's not a big surprise that casual riders ride longer than members as they may be using the bike for recreational purposes. One thing that surprises me is that casual riders' highest average duration of the ride is during winter.  \r\n",
